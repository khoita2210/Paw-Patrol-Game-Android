# CW1-Paw-patrol-theme
# The CW folder contains all the file of the project. After I can not try the CLI method as showed by Cherry to fix the problem "more than 100 files", I dowloaded the github desktop app and try to clone and push whole project folder to this respository. And it's WORK. So I updated and started this method today 12/11/2020  
# Files which is outside the CW folder for instance:
+ MainActivity.java
+ colors.xml
+ play_activity.xml
+ strings.xml
+ styles.xml 
+ .idea
# Those are the file that I uploaded before I fixed the "more than 100 files" problem, I will keep those files to prove that I have start on 26/10/2020 and made some changes to the project
